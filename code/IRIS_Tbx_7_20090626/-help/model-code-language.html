It consists of sections that declare the variables and parameters used in the model, and sections that describe the model's equations. In addition, the language offers a number of other tools that will help you write the model codes efficiently and conveniently.</p><p>You can combine the various model code sections in any order, and each type of sections can occur in the code any number of times. In that case, they will be simply combined together in the end. This is mainly for your convenience: You can split the code into several logical bits, save them, for instance, in separate files, and re-use them in a number of other models using the <a href="#!import">!import</a> command.</p><p>Remeber that each IRIS model must have at least one transition (aka endogenous) variable, and, accordingly, one transition equation. As a consequence, you must always use at least two of the model code language's keywords: <a href="#!variables:transition">!variables:transition</a>, to start a section with that lists the transition variables, and <a href="#!equations:transition">!equations:transition</a>, to start a section with the transition equations.</p><p>All IRIS keywords start with an exclamation point, "!". This way, the model codes can be syntax-highlighted in the built-in Matlab editor, see the hints and tips on <a href="hints-and-tips.html#syntax-highlighting">syntax highlighting</a>. For backward compatibility reasons, though, you can still use an at sign, "@", instead.</p><div class="go-to-top-of-page"><a href="#top_of_page">Top of page</a> | <a href="#list_of_keywords">List of keywords</a></div></div><div class="boxed"><div class="topic-name-remark" id="list_of_keywords" name="list_of_keywords">Model code language</div><h2>List of <span>keywords</span></h2>

You can have as many deterministic trend sections as you wish; they all will be combined together at the time the model is being read into the Matlab workspace.</p><p>You can add a constant trend and/or a linear time trend to any measurement variable to create a wedcge between what is implied by the model and what is expected to be observed in the data. This constant or time trend is then automatically added to your simulation results, or subtracted from the measurement data you supply into the Kalman filter. Remeber, however, that the <a href="hints-and-tips.html#steady-state">steady-state</a> values for measurement variables in non-linear models are always specified/computed without the effect of their deterministic trend additions.</p><p>You can use the model's parameters in the expressions for the deterministic trends. If a parameter occurs only in the specification of deterministic trends (and not in any of the model's transition or measurement equations), you can estimate it when running a Kalman filter by concentrating it out of the likelihood function; see the <a href="model-functions.html#filter">filter</a> function for details on estimating parameters concentrated out of likelihood. This is a very easy and efficient technique.</p><p>The individual equations can have labels attached to them. The labels, enclosed in single quotes or double quotes, need to immediately precede the respective equations. You can use percent signs (which are otherwise considered to start a comment) or apostrophes within the labels. In the latter case, you must put the labels in double quotes, not single quotes, for obvious reason. Equations can stretch over multiple lines, and must end with semicolons. </p></div><h3>Example</h3><div class="example"><p>The syntax somewhat differs for the mesurement variables that are linearised, and those that are log-linearised (use the <a href="#!variables:log">!variables:log</a> section to control the approximation method). For linearised measurement variables, you specify a deterministic trend as follows:</p><pre>!equations:dtrends
   x_ += 2 + alpha;
   y_ += 0.5*!ttrend;
</pre><p>where x_ and y_ are linearised measurement variables. The respective measurement variables must always appear on the left-hand side, while the right-hand side must not refer to any variables at all, only to parameters, fixed numbers, and/or the keyword <a href="#!ttrend">!ttrend</a>. Mind the "+=" (plus-equal) sign between the LHS and RHS.</p><p>For log-linearised measurement variables, you can specify deterministic trends only in their logaritms:</p><pre>!equations:dtrends
   log(X_) += 2 + alpha;
   log(Y_) += 0.5*!ttrend;

You can have as many reporting equation sections as you wish; they all will be combined together at the time the model is being read into the Matlab workspace.</p><p>Reporting equations are a special kind of equations. They are not connected to the rest of the model in any way, may refer, or introduce, variables that are not declared in the model, and are never evaluated together with the rest of the model (when you, for instance, call the <a href="model-functions.html#simulate">simulate</a> or <a href="model-functions.html#filter">filter</a> functions). You will usually use them if you want to compute various transformations or identities (sometimes called reporting variables) for a particular database, such as a forecast database. You need to run the <a href="model-functions.html#reporting">reporting</a> function to evaluate the reporting equations.</p><p>Each reporting equation must have a single variable without lag or lead on the left-hand side, and its definition (i.e. an expression) on the right-hand side, The reporting equations are evaluated in a loop, period by period. All variables or quantities on the RHS must be either available from the input database (see the input arguments for the <a href="model-functions.html#reporting">reporting</a> function used to evaluated reporting equations), or defined by another equations evaluated before.</p><p>The individual equations can have labels attached to them. The labels, enclosed in single quotes or double quotes, need to immediately precede the respective equations. You can use percent signs (which are otherwise considered to start a comment) or apostrophes within the labels. In the latter case, you must put the labels in double quotes, not single quotes, for obvious reason.

   GDP = C + I + G + X - M;
   'GDP growth' dot_GDP = 400*log(GDP/GDP{-1});
</pre><p>In this example, we first construct GDP based on components that are supposed to  be supplied in the input database. Then, we compute its growth rate. The RHS expression in the second equation refers to values defined in the previous equation.</p></div><div class="go-to-top-of-page"><a href="#top_of_page">Top of page</a> | <a href="#list_of_keywords">List of keywords</a></div></div><div class="boxed" id="!equations:transition" name="!equations:transition"><div class="topic-name-remark">Model code language</div><h2>!equations:transition</h2><div class="keyword-brief">List of transition equations.</div><h3>Description</h3><div class="description"><p>This keyword starts a measurement equation section.

The syntax of the for-do-end command is as follows:</p><pre>!for
   <i>list_of_substitutions</i>
!do
   <i>pattern</i>
!end</pre><p>The pattern is repeatedly used to generate segments of the model code, once for each item in the list of substitutions (the individual items needs to be separated by commas, semicolons, or new lines). In each iteration, any occurrence of "&lt;?&gt;" in the pattern is replaced with the currently processed item from the list. You can also use "&lt;+?&gt;" to convert the item to upper-case characters, or "&lt;-?&gt;" to convert it to lower-case characters.</p><p>Remember that the for-do-end command is executed at the time the model code is being read into the Matlab workspace.

!end</pre><p>Although the if-else-end switches are most often used in equation sections, they can, in fact, appear anywhere in the model code with the same effect.</p><p>You will typically use the if-else-end switch to maintain multiple versions of the model in just one code (for instance, flexible-price versus sticky-price versions). The condition after the keyword "!if" can refer to any parameters (you can even introduce auxiliary parameters that are only used in these if-else-end conditions). However, because the if-else-end switch is evaluated when you read the model code into the Matlab workspace, the parameters used in these conditions must be known at that time. You must, therefore, pass them into the <a href="model-functions.html#model">model</a> function through its optional argument 'assign'.
</p><p>Remember that once the model is read into the Matlab workspace, the ignored parts of the if-else-end swtiches are discarded. To get another version of the model, you must read the code again with different parameters.</p></div><h3>Example</h3><div class="example"><p>We assume that in the following example equations, P, Q, and pie are transition variables, omega is a residual, and beta, kappa, and mu are parameters.</p><pre>!equation:transition

The dynamic links can be recursive, and are always evaluate in order of their appearance in the model code file.

You can also add labels to the individual shocks. The labels, enclosed in single quotes or double quotes, need to immediately precede the respective name. You can use percent signs (which are otherwise considered to start a comment) or apostrophes within the labels. In the latter case, you must put the labels in double quotes, not single quotes, for obvious reason. Unlike with the transition or measurement variables, you cannot assign steady-state values to the shocks, since their steady states are fixed at zero. Finally, the shocks are always linearised, and hence you cannot put them on the  <a href="#!variables:log">!variables:log</a> list.</p></div><h3>Example</h3><div class="example"><pre>
!shocks:transition
   'Demand shock' epsilon1;
   'Supply shock' epsilon2, epsilon3
</pre><p>We declare three transition shocks called epsilon1, epsilon2, and epsilon3. The first two of the shocks, epsilon1 and epsilon2, have labels attached to them: 'Demand shock' and 'Supply shock', respectively.
